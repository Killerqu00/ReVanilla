# ReVanilla
Minecraft Fabric Modpack created for adding optimization and QoL features into vanilla Minecraft.

## Why?
Because Vanilla Minecraft is far from perfect.
Here are the goals I am planning to achieve with this modpack:
- **Fully client-side**
This modpack will be completely client-sided. You can join Vanilla servers freely.
- **Declutter**
Some things are not needed in the game. This includes telemetry and chat reports. Modpack will get rid of them for you.
- **QoL features**
Minecraft lacks certain functions that are needed in the game, such as better keybindings manager, certain interface improvements and other small things.
- **Optimization**
And, of course, this modpack includes improvements to the game performance. This also comes with support of OptiFine-format resources (such as CIT) and support for shaderpacks.
